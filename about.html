                    <h2>About The Ferret Aid Society</h2>
                    <p>Most ferrets come to us either sick, malnourished, or near death. We are a “no kill” shelter, meaning we never put our ferrets to sleep due to age, overcrowding, or treatable illness. We rely on donations from animal lovers to keep running, and you’re always welcome to adopt one of our babies.</p>
                    <p>The shelter is run entirely by volunteers with no paid employees. Despite being a registered non-profit organization, we receive no outside funding.</p>
                    <p>Randy Belair founded The Ferret Aid Society. She moved on to welcoming ferrets on the other side of the rainbow bridge in 2021. We miss her dearly, and none of this would be in place without her. The following is her story on how the shelter came to be:</p>
                    <p>“Our shelter officially opened its doors to ferrets in October 1996. Lucky was our first successful rescue ferret, coming from a local animal pound where he was hours away from being killed.</p>
                    <p>We love and treat all the ferrets who come through our doors as if they were our own. It’s hard to see them go, but we always know they are going to loving homes.</p>

                    <h3>Our History</h3>
                    <p>In October 1994, I received a call about a ferret abandoned in a Brampton garbage dump. When my mom and I arrived, we were shocked and repulsed by the scene: broken glass, rotten food, and a sickening stench. We searched for four hours with no luck. If we didn’t find the ferret soon, it would die. Contrary to common belief, ferrets are not wild animals and cannot survive if released.</p>
                    <p>No animal welfare group would help us. The SPCA, Humane Society, and Animal Control all told me to call wildlife services. Frustrated, I called the Mississauga Wildlife Services, who reluctantly agreed to help, knowing ferrets aren’t wild animals. They loaned us a live trap and gave some much-needed advice.</p>
                    <p>Mom and I set the trap and searched the dump for hours. Each night, I returned to the trap, only to find it empty. My mom encouraged me, and we made several trips daily, hoping to find the ferret safe. Finally, on day eight, a caretaker saw the ferret run behind a wall of bricks. We gathered friends and moved the bricks, finding his food stash and eventually, his lifeless body. He had died waiting for me. I broke down and vowed never to let this happen to another ferret.</p>
                    <p>We named him “Our Little Hope.” From then on, mom and I began rescuing ferrets, leading to the creation of The Ferret Aid Society.</p>
                    <p>The Ferret Aid Society is a non-profit shelter for ferrets with no paid employees. Founded in memory of “Our Little Hope,” it continues to rescue and adopt ferrets while promoting humane education and activism. They never kill their ferrets due to overcrowding and never turn a needy ferret away.</p>
                    <p>If you would like to contact the shelter, email us at <a href="mailto:ferretaid@ferretaid.org" title="Email Us">ferretaid@ferretaid.org</a>.</p>
